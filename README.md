# Description
Welcome to Jinny, your personal virtual fashion guide powered by advanced AI!
Jinny can help you choose the best outfit, give styling advice, and rate your looks — just like a friendly fashion expert.

# Features
1. Upload an outfit image — Jinny analyzes your outfit, detects colors, garment type, and gives detailed feedback.
2. Get personalized text advice — Just type your message, even without an image, and get creative styling tips.

# How it works
1. We use BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) to generate a caption for your uploaded outfit image and detect garment type.
2. We extract color palettes using ColorThief.
3. We use FLAN-T5, a powerful language model, to generate detailed, friendly, and descriptive feedback.
4. The user interface is built with Gradio, so you can chat easily and interact in real time.
